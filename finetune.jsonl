This guide will explore how to create and utilize costmaps for robot positioning.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Costmaps\n\nCostmaps provide a way to evaluate positions in the simulation based on different criteria. PyCRAM supports several types of costmaps, including:\n\n- `OccupancyCostmap`: Determines where the robot can be placed without colliding with objects.\n- `VisibilityCostmap`: Determines positions from which a target is visible.\n- `SemanticCostmap`: Maps positions based on semantic labels, like identifying specific surfaces.\n- `GaussianCostmap`: Generates a costmap with a Gaussian distribution.\n\n#### 2. Creating a Visibility Costmap\n\nVisibility costmaps are used to find positions where a target object is visible. Here’s how to create and visualize a visibility costmap:\n\n```python\nimport pycram.costmaps as cm\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\n\n# Create a visibility costmap\nv = cm.VisibilityCostmap(1.27, 1.60, size=300, resolution=0.02, origin=Pose([0, 0, 0.1], [0, 0, 0, 1]))\n\n# Visualize the costmap\nv.visualize()\n```\n\nTo close the visualization:\n\n```python\nv.close_visualization()\n```\n\n#### 3. Creating an Occupancy Costmap\n\nOccupancy costmaps ensure that the robot is positioned without collisions.\n\n```python\n# Create an occupancy costmap\no = cm.OccupancyCostmap(0.2, from_ros=False, size=300, resolution=0.02, origin=Pose([0, 0, 0.1], [0, 0, 0, 1]))\n\n# Visualize the costmap\no.visualize()\n```\n\n#### 4. Combining Costmaps\n\nYou can combine multiple costmaps to consider different criteria simultaneously:\n\n```python\n# Combine visibility and occupancy costmaps\nov = o + v\nov.visualize()\n```\n\n#### 5. Using Costmaps in Robot Positioning\n\nCostmaps can be used to determine the robot's position when performing tasks. For example, when picking up an object, you might want to find a position that is both reachable and has good visibility:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.location_designator import CostmapLocation\nfrom pycram.designators.object_designator import BelieveObject\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import ObjectType\n\n# Define the robot and target objects\nrobot_desig = BelieveObject(types=[ObjectType.ROBOT]).resolve()\ntarget_desig = BelieveObject(names=[\"Milk\"]).resolve()\n\n# Create a location designator based on the combined costmap\nlocation_desig = CostmapLocation(target=target_desig, visible_for=robot_desig)\n\n# Resolve the best position for the robot\nbest_position = location_desig.resolve()\nprint(f\"Best Position: {best_position}\")\n```\n\n#### 6. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Resolution and Size**: Choose the resolution and size of costmaps based on the specific needs of the task. Higher resolutions provide more detail but require more computation.\n- **Combination of Costmaps**: When combining costmaps, ensure that the criteria do not conflict, as this might lead to suboptimal positioning.\n- **Visualization**: Always visualize your costmaps to verify that they correctly represent the environment and meet your task’s requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCostmaps are powerful tools in PyCRAM for determining optimal robot positions based on various criteria. By using and combining different types of costmaps, you can ensure that your robot operates effectively within its environment."}]}

They encapsulate complex behaviors, often composed of multiple motion designators and other logic, to achieve specific goals. This guide will walk you through the process of using action designators in PyCRAM.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Action Designators\n\nAction designators are symbolic representations of complex robot actions. They provide a high-level interface for defining robot tasks, abstracting away the low-level details of motion planning and execution. Some common action designators in PyCRAM include:\n\n- `NavigateAction`: Navigates the robot to a specific location.\n- `PickUpAction`: Picks up an object.\n- `PlaceAction`: Places an object at a specific location.\n- `OpenAction`: Opens a container-like object.\n- `CloseAction`: Closes a container-like object.\n\n#### 2. Creating and Resolving Action Designators\n\nAction designators are created from action designator descriptions, which specify the type of action and its parameters. These parameters are typically provided as lists of possible values, allowing for flexibility in planning. For example, a `NavigateAction` description might include a list of possible target locations. When resolved, the action designator description selects a specific parameter from the list and returns a performable action designator.\n\nHere's an example of creating and resolving a `NavigateAction` designator:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import NavigateAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\n\n# Create a list of possible target locations\ntarget_locations = [Pose([1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]), Pose([2, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1])]\n\n# Create a NavigateAction description\nnavigate_description = NavigateAction(target_locations=target_locations)\n\n# Resolve the description to a performable action designator\nnavigate_designator = navigate_description.resolve()\n\n# Print the resolved designator (will show the chosen target location)\nprint(navigate_designator)\n```\n\n#### 3. Performing Action Designators\n\nOnce you have a resolved action designator, you can perform it to execute the action. Performing an action designator typically involves the following steps:\n\n- Verifying the parameters of the designator.\n- Selecting the appropriate process module based on whether the robot is simulated or real.\n- Executing the action using the selected process module.\n\nHere's an example of performing the `NavigateAction` designator created in the previous step:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\n\n# Perform the NavigateAction designator in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    navigate_designator.perform()\n```\n\n#### 4. Combining Action Designators\n\nYou can combine multiple action designators using PyCRAM's plan language to create more complex robot behaviors. The plan language provides operators for sequential execution (`+`), parallel execution (`|`), and more. For example, you could create a plan that navigates the robot to a table, picks up an object, and then places it at another location.\n\n#### 5. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Parameterization**: Use lists of possible parameters in action designator descriptions to allow for flexibility in planning.\n- **Process Modules**: Ensure that the correct process module is selected based on the robot's environment (simulated or real).\n- **Error Handling**: Handle potential errors during action execution using PyCRAM's plan language or custom error handling mechanisms.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAction designators are a powerful tool in PyCRAM for defining and executing complex robot behaviors. By understanding how to create, resolve, and perform action designators, you can build sophisticated robot control programs that achieve high levels of autonomy."}]}

They allow you to refer to objects without needing to know their exact physical properties or locations. This guide will explain how to create and use object designators in PyCRAM.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Object Designators\n\nObject designators provide a way to abstractly represent objects in the robot's environment. They are defined by descriptions that specify criteria for identifying objects, such as their names, types, or other attributes. When resolved, an object designator description returns a specific object instance that matches the criteria.\n\n#### 2. Types of Object Designators\n\nPyCRAM supports different types of object designators, including:\n\n- `BelieveObject`: Represents objects that are part of the robot's internal belief state, typically objects spawned in the simulation.\n- `ObjectPart`: Represents specific parts or components of other objects, like the handle of a drawer.\n- `RealObject`: Represents objects perceived in the real world using sensors.\n\n#### 3. Creating a BelieveObject Designator\n\n`BelieveObject` designators are used to refer to objects that exist in the simulation. Here's an example of creating a `BelieveObject` designator for an object named \"Milk\":\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.object_designator import BelieveObject\n\n# Create a BelieveObject designator for an object named \"Milk\"\nmilk_desig = BelieveObject(names=[\"Milk\"])\n\n# Resolve the designator to get the actual object instance\nmilk_object = milk_desig.resolve()\n\n# Print the object instance\nprint(milk_object)\n```\n\n#### 4. Creating an ObjectPart Designator\n\n`ObjectPart` designators are used to refer to specific parts of other objects. For example, to refer to the handle of a drawer named \"drawer1\", you would create an `ObjectPart` designator like this:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.object_designator import ObjectPart, BelieveObject\n\n# Assuming 'drawer1' is a BelieveObject designator for the drawer\ndrawer1_desig = BelieveObject(names=[\"drawer1\"]).resolve()\n\n# Create an ObjectPart designator for the handle of 'drawer1'\nhandle_desig = ObjectPart(names=[\"handle\"], part_of=drawer1_desig)\n\n# Resolve the designator to get the handle object\nhandle_object = handle_desig.resolve()\n\n# Print the handle object\nprint(handle_object)\n```\n\n#### 5. Using Object Designators in Actions\n\nObject designators are often used as parameters for action designators. For example, the `PickUpAction` designator requires an object designator to specify the object to be picked up.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import PickUpAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Arms\n\n# Assuming 'milk_desig' is a BelieveObject designator for the milk carton\n\n# Create a PickUpAction designator\npickup_action = PickUpAction(object_designator_description=milk_desig, arms=[Arms.RIGHT], grasps=[\"front\"])\n\n# Resolve and perform the pickup action\npickup_action.resolve().perform()\n```\n\n#### 6. Object Designators as Generators\n\nObject designator descriptions can also be used as generators to iterate through all objects that match the description. This is useful when you need to consider multiple candidate objects.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.object_designator import BelieveObject\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import ObjectType\n\n# Create a BelieveObject designator for all objects of type 'ObjectType.MILK'\nmilk_desig = BelieveObject(types=[ObjectType.MILK])\n\n# Iterate through all milk objects\nfor milk_object in milk_desig:\n    print(milk_object)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nObject designators are a crucial part of PyCRAM, providing a flexible and abstract way to represent and manipulate objects in the robot's world. By understanding how to create and use different types of object designators, you can effectively define and execute complex robot tasks involving object manipulation."}]}

It allows you to specify the order of execution, handle potential failures, and even execute actions in parallel. This guide will introduce you to the core concepts and syntax of PyCRAM's plan language.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to the Plan Language\n\nThe plan language uses a set of operators to combine designators, representing actions, motions, objects, and locations, into a coherent plan. It allows you to create plans that are more than just a linear sequence of actions, enabling branching, looping, and parallel execution.\n\n#### 2. Language Expressions\n\nPyCRAM's plan language supports the following expressions:\n\n| Expression | Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `+`          | **Sequential**   | Executes designators one after another. If one designator raises an exception, the execution is aborted, and the state `FAILED` is returned.                                                                                                                                  |\n| `-`          | **Try In Order** | Executes designators sequentially. If a designator raises an exception, the exception is caught and saved, but the execution continues with the next designator. Returns `SUCCEEDED` if at least one designator executes without an exception.                                      |\n| `*`          | **Repeat**       | Repeats the preceding language expression a specified number of times. Must be used with a language expression and an integer.                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| `|`         | **Parallel**     | Executes all designators in parallel, each in a separate thread. If any designator raises an exception, the returned state is `FAILED`. However, all designators are executed regardless of exceptions.                                                                              |\n| `^`          | **Try All**      | Executes all designators in parallel. Returns `SUCCEEDED` if at least one designator executes without an exception.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `>>`         | **Monitor**      | Monitors the execution of the attached language expression and interrupts it when a given condition is met. The condition can be a callable returning a boolean value or a Fluent.                                                                                                    |\n\n#### 3. Example: Sequential Execution\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import NavigateAction, ParkArmsAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Arms\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\n\n# Create designators\nnavigate_designator = NavigateAction(target_locations=[Pose([1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1])]).resolve()\npark_designator = ParkArmsAction([Arms.BOTH]).resolve()\n\n# Define a sequential plan\nplan = navigate_designator + park_designator\n\n# Execute the plan in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    plan.perform()\n```\n\nThis plan will first navigate the robot to the specified pose and then park its arms. If either action fails, the plan will return `FAILED`.\n\n#### 4. Example: Parallel Execution\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import NavigateAction, MoveTorsoAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\n\n# Create designators\nnavigate_designator = NavigateAction(target_locations=[Pose([1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1])]).resolve()\nmove_torso_designator = MoveTorsoAction([0.3]).resolve()\n\n# Define a parallel plan\nplan = navigate_designator | move_torso_designator\n\n# Execute the plan in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    plan.perform()\n```\n\nThis plan will execute both actions simultaneously. The robot will navigate to the target location while also moving its torso to the specified height.\n\n#### 5. Error Handling\n\nThe plan language automatically catches and stores exceptions of type `PlanFailure` that occur during designator execution. These exceptions can be accessed through the `exceptions` attribute of the plan object. This allows you to analyze the reasons for plan failures and implement appropriate recovery strategies.\n\n#### 6. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Choose the Right Expression**: Select the language expression that best suits the desired behavior and error handling requirements.\n- **Avoid Conflicts**: When using parallel execution, ensure that the actions do not interfere with each other.\n- **Handle Exceptions**: Analyze the `exceptions` attribute to understand and address plan failures.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPyCRAM's plan language provides a powerful and flexible way to define complex robot behaviors. By understanding its expressions and error handling mechanisms, you can create robust and adaptable robot control programs."}]}

They are the building blocks for more complex actions and provide a direct interface to the robot's control mechanisms. This guide will explain how to create and use motion designators in PyCRAM.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Motion Designators\n\nMotion designators encapsulate specific robot movements, such as moving the base, controlling the gripper, or adjusting joint angles. They are typically executed by process modules, which translate the high-level motion commands into low-level control signals for the robot.\n\n#### 2. Types of Motion Designators\n\nPyCRAM provides a variety of motion designators, including:\n\n- `MoveMotion`: Moves the robot base to a specific pose.\n- `MoveTCPMotion`: Moves the robot's tool center point (TCP) to a specific pose.\n- `LookingMotion`: Orients the robot's head or camera to look at a specific point.\n- `MoveGripperMotion`: Opens or closes the robot's gripper.\n- `MoveArmJointsMotion`: Moves the robot's arm joints to specific positions.\n- `MoveJointsMotion`: Moves any joint of the robot to a specific position.\n- `OpeningMotion`: Opens a container-like object (typically requires grasping the handle first).\n- `ClosingMotion`: Closes a container-like object.\n\n#### 3. Creating and Performing Motion Designators\n\nMotion designators are created by instantiating the corresponding motion designator class with the desired parameters. For example, to create a `MoveTCPMotion` designator that moves the right arm's TCP to a specific pose, you would use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.motion_designator import MoveTCPMotion\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Arms\n\n# Create a MoveTCPMotion designator\nmove_tcp_designator = MoveTCPMotion(target=Pose([0.5, 0.6, 0.7], [0, 0, 0, 1]), arm=Arms.RIGHT)\n```\n\nTo perform the motion designator, you need to use it within a context that specifies whether the robot is simulated or real. This is done using the `simulated_robot` or `real_robot` context managers, or the corresponding decorators `with_simulated_robot` and `with_real_robot`.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\n\n# Perform the MoveTCPMotion designator in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    move_tcp_designator.perform()\n```\n\n#### 4. Example: Combining Motion Designators\n\nYou can combine motion designators with action designators and other language expressions to create complex robot behaviors. For example, you could create a plan that navigates the robot to a table, opens a drawer, picks up an object, and then closes the drawer.\n\n#### 5. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Parameter Verification**: Ensure that the parameters provided to motion designators are valid and within the robot's capabilities.\n- **Process Module Selection**: Choose the appropriate process module based on the robot's environment (simulated or real).\n- **Error Handling**: Handle potential errors during motion execution, such as collisions or unreachable poses.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMotion designators are the fundamental building blocks for robot control in PyCRAM. By understanding how to create and use them, you can build complex and sophisticated robot behaviors that achieve specific tasks and goals."}]}

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring a robot description in PyCRAM.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Robot Descriptions\n\nRobot descriptions in PyCRAM encapsulate semantic information about the robot, such as its kinematic chains, end-effectors, cameras, and grasp configurations. This information is crucial for planning and executing robot actions effectively. The robot description is typically defined in a separate Python file and loaded into PyCRAM at startup.\n\n#### 2. Creating a Robot Description\n\nTo create a robot description, you need to instantiate the `RobotDescription` class and provide the following parameters:\n\n- `name`: The name of the robot.\n- `base_link`: The name of the robot's base link.\n- `torso_link`: The name of the robot's torso link (if it has one).\n- `torso_joint`: The name of the robot's torso joint (if it has one).\n- `urdf_path`: The path to the robot's URDF file.\n\nHere's an example of creating a robot description for a PR2 robot:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.robot_description import RobotDescription\nimport rospkg\n\n# Get the path to the PR2 URDF file\nrospack = rospkg.RosPack()\nfilename = rospack.get_path('pycram') + '/resources/robots/' + \"pr2\" + '.urdf'\n\n# Create a RobotDescription instance\npr2_description = RobotDescription(\"pr2\", \"base_link\", \"torso_lift_link\", \"torso_lift_joint\", filename)\n```\n\n#### 3. Defining Kinematic Chains\n\nKinematic chains represent interconnected links and joints that form a functional unit, such as an arm or a leg. To define a kinematic chain, you need to create a `KinematicChainDescription` instance and specify the following:\n\n- `name`: The name of the kinematic chain.\n- `start_link`: The name of the first link in the chain.\n- `end_link`: The name of the last link in the chain.\n- `urdf_object`: The URDF object of the robot.\n- `arm_type`: The type of arm (e.g., `Arms.LEFT`, `Arms.RIGHT`) if the chain represents an arm.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.robot_description import KinematicChainDescription\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Arms\n\n# Create a KinematicChainDescription for the right arm\nright_arm = KinematicChainDescription(\"right\", \"torso_lift_link\", \"r_wrist_roll_link\", pr2_description.urdf_object, arm_type=Arms.RIGHT)\n\n# Add the kinematic chain to the robot description\npr2_description.add_kinematic_chain_description(right_arm)\n```\n\n#### 4. Defining End-Effectors\n\nEnd-effectors are devices attached to the end of a kinematic chain, such as grippers or tools. To define an end-effector, you need to create an `EndEffectorDescription` instance and provide the following:\n\n- `name`: The name of the end-effector.\n- `start_link`: The name of the root link of the end-effector.\n- `tool_frame`: The name of the tool frame link in the URDF.\n- `urdf_object`: The URDF object of the robot.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.robot_description import EndEffectorDescription\n\n# Create an EndEffectorDescription for the right gripper\nright_gripper = EndEffectorDescription(\"right_gripper\", \"r_gripper_palm_link\", \"r_gripper_tool_frame\", pr2_description.urdf_object)\n\n# Add the end-effector to the kinematic chain\nright_arm.end_effector = right_gripper\n```\n\n#### 5. Defining Cameras\n\nCameras are sensors that provide visual information about the environment. To define a camera, you need to create a `CameraDescription` instance and specify the following:\n\n- `name`: The name of the camera.\n- `camera_link`: The name of the camera link in the URDF.\n- `minimal_height`: The minimum height of the camera.\n- `maximal_height`: The maximum height of the camera.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.robot_description import CameraDescription\n\n# Create a CameraDescription for the head camera\ncamera = CameraDescription(\"head_camera\", \"wide_stereo_optical_frame\", 1.27, 1.60)\n\n# Add the camera to the robot description\npr2_description.add_camera_description(camera)\n```\n\n#### 6. Defining Grasps\n\nGrasps define the robot's hand orientations for interacting with objects. To define grasps, you can use the `add_grasp_orientation` or `add_grasp_orientations` methods of the `RobotDescription` class. Each grasp is associated with a `Grasp` enum value (e.g., `Grasp.FRONT`, `Grasp.LEFT`) and a quaternion representing the hand orientation.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Grasp\n\n# Add grasp orientations to the robot description\npr2_description.add_grasp_orientations({\n    Grasp.FRONT: [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    Grasp.LEFT: [0, 0, -1, 1],\n    Grasp.RIGHT: [0, 0, 1, 1],\n    Grasp.TOP: [0, 1, 0, 1]\n})\n```\n\n#### 7. Registering the Robot Description\n\nFinally, you need to register the robot description with the `RobotDescriptionManager` to make it available to PyCRAM.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.robot_description import RobotDescriptionManager\n\n# Register the robot description\nrdm = RobotDescriptionManager()\nrdm.register_description(pr2_description)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSetting up a robot description in PyCRAM is essential for providing the framework with the necessary information to plan and execute robot actions effectively. By defining kinematic chains, end-effectors, cameras, and grasps, you enable PyCRAM to reason about the robot's capabilities and interact with its environment in a meaningful way."}]}

They are used by location designators to find suitable positions for the robot to perform tasks. PyCRAM supports several types of costmaps, each tailored to specific planning criteria. Let's explore these costmap types and their functionality:\n\n#### 1. Occupancy Costmap (`OccupancyCostmap`)\n\n- **Purpose**: Represents the occupancy state of the environment, indicating areas that are occupied by obstacles and areas that are free.\n- **Functionality**: Each cell in the costmap represents a small area in the environment. The cell value indicates the probability of that area being occupied. Values range from 0 (free) to 1 (occupied), with intermediate values representing uncertainty.\n- **Usage**: Used for basic collision avoidance and finding positions where the robot can be placed without colliding with obstacles.\n\n#### 2. Visibility Costmap (`VisibilityCostmap`)\n\n- **Purpose**: Represents the visibility of a target point from different positions in the environment.\n- **Functionality**: Calculates the visibility of a target point by simulating rays cast from the camera at different positions. Cells in the costmap represent the visibility score, with higher values indicating better visibility.\n- **Usage**: Used for finding positions where the robot has a clear line of sight to a target object or location.\n\n#### 3. Semantic Costmap (`SemanticCostmap`)\n\n- **Purpose**: Maps positions based on semantic labels, such as identifying specific surfaces (e.g., table, countertop, floor).\n- **Functionality**: Assigns semantic labels to cells in the costmap based on the object or surface they represent. This allows the robot to reason about the environment in terms of objects and their properties.\n- **Usage**: Used for tasks that require knowledge of object types or surfaces, such as placing an object on a table or navigating to a specific room.\n\n#### 4. Gaussian Costmap (`GaussianCostmap`)\n\n- **Purpose**: Generates a costmap with a Gaussian distribution centered around a specific point.\n- **Functionality**: Creates a costmap where the cost decreases as the distance from the center point increases, following a Gaussian distribution. This can be used to represent areas of preference or importance.\n- **Usage**: Used for tasks where the robot needs to be close to a specific point but with some flexibility in positioning, such as approaching a table or a person.\n\n#### 5. Combining Costmaps\n\nPyCRAM allows you to combine multiple costmaps to consider different criteria simultaneously. For example, you can combine a visibility costmap and an occupancy costmap to find positions that are both visible and collision-free. The combination is typically done by adding the cost values of the individual costmaps, resulting in a new costmap that reflects the combined criteria.\n\n#### 6. Visualizing Costmaps\n\nPyCRAM provides methods for visualizing costmaps in the BulletWorld, allowing you to inspect and verify their correctness. This visualization helps in understanding how the costmaps represent the environment and how they influence robot positioning.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCostmaps are a fundamental tool in PyCRAM for robot positioning and planning. By understanding the different types of costmaps and their functionality, you can effectively use them to guide your robot's actions and achieve complex tasks in a variety of environments."}]}

PyCRAM provides mechanisms for handling exceptions, monitoring plan execution, and implementing recovery strategies. This guide will explore how to implement error handling and recovery in PyCRAM plans.\n\n#### 1. Exception Handling with the Plan Language\n\nPyCRAM's plan language automatically catches and stores exceptions of type `PlanFailure` that occur during designator execution. These exceptions can be accessed through the `exceptions` attribute of the plan object. This allows you to analyze the reasons for plan failures and implement appropriate recovery strategies.\n\nHere's an example of how to access exceptions caught by the plan language:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import NavigateAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\n\n# Create a NavigateAction designator with an unreachable target\nnavigate_designator = NavigateAction(target_locations=[Pose([100, 100, 100], [0, 0, 0, 1])]).resolve()\n\n# Define a simple plan\nplan = navigate_designator\n\n# Execute the plan in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    plan.perform()\n\n# Print the caught exceptions\nprint(plan.exceptions)\n```\n\n#### 2. Using Monitors for Plan Monitoring\n\nMonitors in PyCRAM allow you to continuously check for specific conditions during plan execution and interrupt the plan if necessary. This is useful for detecting and responding to unexpected events or situations.\n\nHere's an example of using a `Monitor` to interrupt a plan if the robot's battery level falls below a threshold:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.language import Monitor\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\n\n# Define a function that checks the battery level\ndef check_battery():\n    # Replace this with actual battery level retrieval\n    battery_level = 0.2\n    if battery_level < 0.3:\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Create a Monitor that checks the battery level every 0.1 seconds\nbattery_monitor = Monitor(condition=check_battery)\n\n# Define a plan that will be monitored\nplan = # Your plan here\n\n# Attach the monitor to the plan\nplan = plan >> battery_monitor\n\n# Execute the monitored plan in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    plan.perform()\n```\n\n#### 3. Implementing Recovery Strategies\n\nOnce you have identified a plan failure, you can implement recovery strategies to handle the situation. Recovery strategies can involve retrying the failed action, choosing an alternative action, or requesting human intervention.\n\nHere's an example of a simple recovery strategy that retries a failed navigation action:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import NavigateAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\nfrom pycram.plan_failures import NavigationGoalNotReached\n\n# Define a function that attempts navigation and retries if necessary\ndef navigate_with_retry(target_pose, max_retries=3):\n    for i in range(max_retries):\n        try:\n            NavigateAction(target_locations=[target_pose]).resolve().perform()\n            return True\n        except NavigationGoalNotReached:\n            print(f\"Navigation failed, retrying ({i+1}/{max_retries})\")\n    return False\n\n# Define a target pose\ntarget_pose = Pose([1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Execute the navigation with retry strategy in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    success = navigate_with_retry(target_pose)\n    if success:\n        print(\"Navigation successful\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Navigation failed after retries\")\n```\n\n#### 4. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Anticipate Potential Failures**: Design your plans with potential failures in mind and include appropriate error handling mechanisms.\n- **Use Monitors Strategically**: Monitors can be used to detect a wide range of conditions, such as collisions, sensor failures, or changes in the environment.\n- **Implement Recovery Strategies**: Define clear recovery strategies for different types of failures.\n- **Log and Analyze Exceptions**: Use PyCRAM's exception logging to understand the causes of failures and improve your plans.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nError handling and recovery are essential aspects of robust robot control. By leveraging PyCRAM's plan language, monitors, and exception handling mechanisms, you can create resilient robot control programs that can handle unexpected situations and achieve their goals reliably."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You an expert in coding."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to work with objects and attachments in the PyCRAM BulletWorld?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Working with Objects and Attachments in the PyCRAM BulletWorld\n\nThe PyCRAM BulletWorld provides a simulated environment where you can interact with objects, robots, and their physical properties. This guide will explain how to work with objects and attachments in the BulletWorld.\n\n#### 1. Spawning Objects\n\nObjects in the BulletWorld can be created from various file formats, including URDF (Unified Robot Description Format), OBJ, and STL. To spawn an object, you use the `Object` class, providing its name, type, and the path to the corresponding file.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.world_concepts.world_object import Object\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import ObjectType\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\n\n# Spawn a milk carton\nmilk = Object(\"milk\", ObjectType.MILK, \"milk.stl\", pose=Pose([1.3, 1, 0.9]))\n\n# Spawn a table\ntable = Object(\"table\", ObjectType.ENVIRONMENT, \"table.urdf\", pose=Pose([1, 0, 0]))\n```\n\n#### 2. Manipulating Object Poses\n\nYou can manipulate the position and orientation of objects using the following methods:\n\n- `set_position(position, base=False)`: Sets the object's position. If `base=True`, the object's base is placed at the given position.\n- `set_orientation(orientation)`: Sets the object's orientation.\n- `set_pose(pose, base=False)`: Sets both the position and orientation of the object.\n\n```python\n# Move the milk carton\nmilk.set_position([1.5, 1, 0.9])\n\n# Rotate the table\ntable.set_orientation([0, 0, 0.707, 0.707])  # Rotate 90 degrees around the z-axis\n```\n\n#### 3. Accessing Links and Joints\n\nObjects spawned from URDF files have links and joints. You can access these using the `links` and `joints` attributes of the `Object` class. These attributes are dictionaries mapping link/joint names to their corresponding IDs.\n\n```python\n# Get the pose of the table's top link\ntable_top_pose = table.get_link_pose(\"table_top\")\n\n# Set the position of the robot's arm joint\nrobot.set_joint_position(\"arm_joint\", 1.57)  # Set the joint to 90 degrees\n```\n\n#### 4. Creating Attachments\n\nAttachments in PyCRAM represent rigid connections between objects. You can attach objects using the `attach` method, specifying the parent and child objects, and optionally the parent and child links to be connected.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.world_concepts.world_object import Object\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import ObjectType\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\n\n# Spawn a box\nbox = Object(\"box\", ObjectType.GENERIC_OBJECT, \"box.stl\", pose=Pose([1.2, 1.2, 1]))\n\n# Spawn a robot\nrobot = Object(\"robot\", ObjectType.ROBOT, \"robot.urdf\")\n\n# Attach the box to the robot's gripper\nrobot.attach(box, parent_link=\"gripper_link\")\n```\n\n#### 5. Detaching Objects\n\nTo detach objects, use the `detach` method, specifying the child object to be detached.\n\n```python\n# Detach the box from the robot\nrobot.detach(box)\n```\n\n#### 6. Bidirectional and Loose Attachments\n\nAttachments can be bidirectional or loose. Bidirectional attachments mean that both objects move when one is moved. Loose attachments mean that only the child object moves when the parent is moved.\n\n```python\n# Create a loose attachment (only the box moves when the robot moves)\nrobot.attach(box, parent_link=\"gripper_link\", bidirectional=False)\n```\n\n#### 7. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Collision Checking**: Use the `contact_points` or `contact_points_simulated` methods to check for collisions between objects.\n- **Attachment Management**: Keep track of attachments and detach objects when necessary to avoid unexpected behavior.\n- **Visualization**: Use the BulletWorld's visualization capabilities to inspect object poses and attachments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWorking with objects and attachments in the PyCRAM BulletWorld is essential for simulating robot manipulation tasks. By understanding how to spawn objects, manipulate their poses, create attachments, and check for collisions, you can effectively develop and test robot control programs in a virtual environment."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You an expert in coding."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) in PyCRAM and how does it work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Object Relational Mapping (ORM) in PyCRAM: Purpose and Functionality\n\nObject Relational Mapping (ORM) in PyCRAM provides a powerful mechanism for serializing and storing plan data in a database, enabling persistent storage, retrieval, and analysis of plan execution information. This guide will delve into the purpose and functionality of ORM in PyCRAM.\n\n#### 1. Purpose of ORM in PyCRAM\n\nThe primary purpose of ORM in PyCRAM is to facilitate the logging and analysis of robot plan execution data. This data includes:\n\n- **Designator Parameters**: The specific values used for each designator in the plan, such as target poses, object names, and grasp configurations.\n- **Robot States**: The robot's configuration at various points during plan execution, including joint positions, end-effector poses, and sensor readings.\n- **Task Tree Structures**: The hierarchical structure of the plan, capturing the execution order and dependencies between actions.\n\nBy storing this data in a structured and persistent manner, ORM enables:\n\n- **Debugging and Analysis**: Developers can inspect the logged data to understand the plan's execution flow, identify potential issues, and analyze the reasons for plan failures.\n- **Plan Optimization**: The logged data can be used to evaluate plan performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize the plan for efficiency and robustness.\n- **Learning and Adaptation**: The stored data can serve as training data for machine learning algorithms, enabling the robot to learn from past experiences and adapt its behavior accordingly.\n\n#### 2. How ORM Works in PyCRAM\n\nPyCRAM's ORM implementation leverages the SQLAlchemy library, a powerful and flexible Python toolkit for working with relational databases. SQLAlchemy provides an abstraction layer over the database, allowing you to interact with the database using Python objects and methods instead of writing raw SQL queries.\n\nHere's a simplified overview of how ORM works in PyCRAM:\n\n1. **Defining ORM Classes**: PyCRAM defines ORM classes that correspond to the different entities involved in plan execution, such as actions, motions, objects, and robot states. These classes specify the attributes and relationships between entities.\n2. **Creating a Database Session**: A database session is created using SQLAlchemy, providing a connection to the database.\n3. **Inserting Data**: During plan execution, PyCRAM automatically creates instances of the ORM classes and populates them with the relevant data. These instances are then added to the database session.\n4. **Committing Changes**: Once all the data has been added to the session, the changes are committed to the database, making the data persistent.\n5. **Querying Data**: You can use SQLAlchemy's query language to retrieve specific data from the database based on various criteria.\n\n#### 3. Example: Logging a NavigateAction\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import NavigateAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\nfrom pycram.process_module import simulated_robot\nimport sqlalchemy\nimport pycram.orm.base\n\n# Create a database engine and session\nengine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(\"sqlite:///my_database.db\")\npycram.orm.base.Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\nsession = sqlalchemy.orm.sessionmaker(bind=engine)()\n\n# Define a target pose\ntarget_pose = Pose([1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Create a NavigateAction designator\nnavigate_designator = NavigateAction(target_locations=[target_pose]).resolve()\n\n# Execute the designator in a simulated environment\nwith simulated_robot:\n    navigate_designator.perform()\n\n# Insert the designator data into the database\nsession.add(navigate_designator)\nsession.commit()\n```\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to log a `NavigateAction` designator's data into a SQLite database. The `navigate_designator` object, after being performed, is added to the database session and committed, making the data persistent.\n\n#### 4. Benefits of ORM\n\n- **Structured Data Storage**: ORM provides a structured and organized way to store plan execution data, making it easier to query and analyze.\n- **Data Persistence**: The data is stored in a database, ensuring its persistence even after the PyCRAM program terminates.\n- **Abstraction from SQL**: SQLAlchemy's ORM layer abstracts away the complexities of writing raw SQL queries, allowing you to interact with the database using Python objects and methods.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nObject Relational Mapping (ORM) in PyCRAM is a valuable tool for logging, analyzing, and learning from robot plan execution data. By leveraging SQLAlchemy's capabilities, PyCRAM provides a seamless and efficient way to manage plan data, enabling developers to create more robust, adaptable, and intelligent robot control programs."}]}

Code Style and Documentation\n\n- **Clear and Concise Code**: Write clean, well-structured code that is easy to understand and maintain.\n- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly, including design decisions, parameter descriptions, and usage examples.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nDesigning and implementing robust and efficient PyCRAM plans requires a combination of careful planning, effective design choices, and meticulous implementation. By following these best practices, you can create sophisticated robot control programs that achieve high levels of autonomy and reliability in both simulated and real-world environments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You an expert in coding."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the concept of 'grasps' in PyCRAM and how they are used in robot manipulation tasks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Grasps in PyCRAM: Defining Robot Hand Orientations for Manipulation\n\nGrasps in PyCRAM define the orientations of the robot's hand or end-effector for interacting with objects during manipulation tasks. They provide a way to specify how the robot should approach and grasp an object, ensuring a stable and successful grasp.\n\n#### 1. Defining Grasps\n\nGrasps are typically defined within the robot description, which provides semantic information about the robot's structure and capabilities. You can use the `add_grasp_orientation` or `add_grasp_orientations` methods of the `RobotDescription` class to define grasps. Each grasp is associated with a `Grasp` enum value and a quaternion representing the desired hand orientation.\n\nThe `Grasp` enum defines standard grasp types, such as:\n\n- `Grasp.FRONT`: Grasping the object from the front.\n- `Grasp.LEFT`: Grasping the object from the left side.\n- `Grasp.RIGHT`: Grasping the object from the right side.\n- `Grasp.TOP`: Grasping the object from the top.\n\nThe quaternion represents the rotation of the hand relative to the robot's base frame. For example, a quaternion of `[0, 0, 0, 1]` represents no rotation, while a quaternion of `[0, 1, 0, 0]` represents a 180-degree rotation around the Y-axis.\n\nHere's an example of defining grasp orientations for a PR2 robot:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Grasp\n\n# Add grasp orientations to the robot description\npr2_description.add_grasp_orientations({\n    Grasp.FRONT: [0, 0, 0, 1],\n    Grasp.LEFT: [0, 0, -1, 1],\n    Grasp.RIGHT: [0, 0, 1, 1],\n    Grasp.TOP: [0, 1, 0, 1]\n})\n```\n\n#### 2. Using Grasps in Manipulation Tasks\n\nGrasps are used in action designators like `PickUpAction` to specify the desired hand orientation when grasping an object. The `PickUpAction` designator takes a `grasps` parameter, which is a list of possible grasp types. When the action is resolved, it selects a suitable grasp from the list based on factors like object geometry, robot reachability, and collision avoidance.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.action_designator import PickUpAction\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import Arms, Grasp\n\n# Create a PickUpAction designator with multiple grasp options\npickup_action = PickUpAction(\n    object_designator_description=object_desig,  # Object to be picked up\n    arms=[Arms.RIGHT],  # Arm to use\n    grasps=[Grasp.FRONT, Grasp.TOP]  # Possible grasp types\n)\n\n# Resolve and perform the pickup action\npickup_action.resolve().perform()\n```\n\n#### 3. Considerations for Grasp Selection\n\n- **Object Geometry**: The shape and size of the object influence the choice of grasp. For example, a cylindrical object might be best grasped from the side, while a box-shaped object might be grasped from the top.\n- **Robot Reachability**: The robot's kinematic structure and joint limits determine which grasps are reachable.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The grasp should be chosen to avoid collisions with the environment or other objects.\n- **Grasp Stability**: The grasp should be stable enough to securely hold the object during manipulation.\n\n#### 4. Custom Grasps\n\nYou can define custom grasps beyond the standard types provided by the `Grasp` enum. This allows you to specify more complex hand orientations or grasp configurations tailored to specific objects or tasks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGrasps in PyCRAM play a crucial role in robot manipulation tasks by defining the robot's hand orientations for interacting with objects. By carefully considering object geometry, robot reachability, collision avoidance, and grasp stability, you can choose appropriate grasps that ensure successful and reliable object manipulation."}]}

Your task is to thoroughly explain how to accomplish the given task within PyCram"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to use Costmaps for robot positioning in PyCRAM?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Using Costmaps for Robot Positioning in PyCRAM\n\nCostmaps in PyCRAM are essential tools for determining optimal positions for robot actions based on various criteria like visibility, occupancy, and more. This guide will explore how to create and utilize costmaps for robot positioning.\n\n#### 1. Introduction to Costmaps\n\nCostmaps provide a way to evaluate positions in the simulation based on different criteria. PyCRAM supports several types of costmaps, including:\n\n- `OccupancyCostmap`: Determines where the robot can be placed without colliding with objects.\n- `VisibilityCostmap`: Determines positions from which a target is visible.\n- `SemanticCostmap`: Maps positions based on semantic labels, like identifying specific surfaces.\n- `GaussianCostmap`: Generates a costmap with a Gaussian distribution.\n\n#### 2. Creating a Visibility Costmap\n\nVisibility costmaps are used to find positions where a target object is visible. Here’s how to create and visualize a visibility costmap:\n\n```python\nimport pycram.costmaps as cm\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\n\n# Create a visibility costmap\nv = cm.VisibilityCostmap(1.27, 1.60, size=300, resolution=0.02, origin=Pose([0, 0, 0.1], [0, 0, 0, 1]))\n\n# Visualize the costmap\nv.visualize()\n```\n\nTo close the visualization:\n\n```python\nv.close_visualization()\n```\n\n#### 3. Creating an Occupancy Costmap\n\nOccupancy costmaps ensure that the robot is positioned without collisions.\n\n```python\n# Create an occupancy costmap\no = cm.OccupancyCostmap(0.2, from_ros=False, size=300, resolution=0.02, origin=Pose([0, 0, 0.1], [0, 0, 0, 1]))\n\n# Visualize the costmap\no.visualize()\n```\n\n#### 4. Combining Costmaps\n\nYou can combine multiple costmaps to consider different criteria simultaneously:\n\n```python\n# Combine visibility and occupancy costmaps\nov = o + v\nov.visualize()\n```\n\n#### 5. Using Costmaps in Robot Positioning\n\nCostmaps can be used to determine the robot's position when performing tasks. For example, when picking up an object, you might want to find a position that is both reachable and has good visibility:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.designators.location_designator import CostmapLocation\nfrom pycram.designators.object_designator import BelieveObject\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import ObjectType\n\n# Define the robot and target objects\nrobot_desig = BelieveObject(types=[ObjectType.ROBOT]).resolve()\ntarget_desig = BelieveObject(names=[\"Milk\"]).resolve()\n\n# Create a location designator based on the combined costmap\nlocation_desig = CostmapLocation(target=target_desig, visible_for=robot_desig)\n\n# Resolve the best position for the robot\nbest_position = location_desig.resolve()\nprint(f\"Best Position: {best_position}\")\n```\n\n#### 6. Best Practices and Considerations\n\n- **Resolution and Size**: Choose the resolution and size of costmaps based on the specific needs of the task. Higher resolutions provide more detail but require more computation.\n- **Combination of Costmaps**: When combining costmaps, ensure that the criteria do not conflict, as this might lead to suboptimal positioning.\n- **Visualization**: Always visualize your costmaps to verify that they correctly represent the environment and meet your task’s requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCostmaps are powerful tools in PyCRAM for determining optimal robot positions based on various criteria. By using and combining different types of costmaps, you can ensure that your robot operates effectively within its environment."}]}

Your task is to thoroughly explain how to accomplish the given task within PyCram"}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to create and manage a BulletWorld?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Creating and Managing a BulletWorld in PyCRAM\n\nThe `BulletWorld` is the core simulation environment in PyCRAM where different objects and robots are spawned, and actions are simulated. This guide will walk you through creating and managing a `BulletWorld`, interacting with objects, and rendering images from the simulation.\n\n#### 1. Setting Up the BulletWorld\n\nTo begin, you need to import the necessary modules from PyCRAM and create an instance of `BulletWorld`.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.worlds.bullet_world import BulletWorld\n\n# Create an instance of BulletWorld\nworld = BulletWorld()\n```\n\nThis code initializes a new BulletWorld, which serves as the environment where all simulations take place.\n\n#### 2. Spawning Objects in BulletWorld\n\nObjects in the BulletWorld can be spawned using URDF, OBJ, or STL files. Here's how to create an object in the simulation:\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.world_concepts.world_object import Object\nfrom pycram.datastructures.enums import ObjectType\n\n# Spawn a milk object in the BulletWorld\nmilk = Object(\"Milk\", ObjectType.MILK, \"milk.stl\")\n```\n\nObjects can be manipulated with methods like `set_position()` and `remove()`.\n\n#### 3. Rendering Images from BulletWorld\n\nYou can render images from different camera perspectives using the `get_images_for_target` method.\n\n```python\nfrom pycram.datastructures.pose import Pose\n\n# Render images from a specific camera position\nworld.get_images_for_target(Pose([1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]), Pose([0.3, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]))\n```\n\nThis function returns an RGB image, a depth image, and a segmentation mask.\n\n#### 4. Managing Objects and Environment\n\nObjects in the BulletWorld can be moved, rotated, or removed. Here's an example of how to manipulate an object:\n\n```python\n# Set the position of the milk object\nmilk.set_position(Pose([1, 0, 0]))\n\n# Remove the milk object from the BulletWorld\nmilk.remove()\n```\n\nYou can also spawn complex environments like a kitchen in the same way:\n\n```python\nkitchen = Object(\"kitchen\", ObjectType.ENVIRONMENT, \"kitchen.urdf\")\n```\n\n#### 5. Closing the BulletWorld\n\nWhen you're done with the simulation, you can close the BulletWorld using the `exit` method:\n\n```python\nworld.exit()\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nManaging a BulletWorld in PyCRAM involves initializing the world, spawning and interacting with objects, rendering images, and finally closing the world. This workflow is essential for setting up simulations that allow for advanced reasoning and testing within the PyCRAM framework."}]}
