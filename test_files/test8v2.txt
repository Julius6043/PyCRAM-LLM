User Instruction: Pick up a spoon, but not one that's already on a table.
---
The following is a pre thinking process for the user instruction. It is not necessarily right especially the Positions. But use it as a foundation for your task:
<thinking>## Picking up a Spoon (Not on a Table)

**Initial stage:**
- **PR2 Robot:** Located at position **[1, 2, 0]**.
- **Spoon1:** Located at **[2.4, 2.2, 0.85]**, attached to 'cabinet10_drawer_top'.
- **Spoon2:** Located at **[2.5, 2.3, 1.00]**.
- **Spoon3:** Located at **[0.4, 3.1, 0.96]**.

**Goal stage:**
- **PR2 Robot:** Holding one of the spoons (Spoon2 or Spoon3) in its gripper.

**Step-by-step plan:**

1. **Identify a suitable spoon:**
   - **Action:** Analyze the world knowledge to identify spoons that are not on a table. 
   - **Decision:** Choose either Spoon2 or Spoon3, as they are not attached to any furniture and are therefore assumed to be not on a table. Let's choose Spoon2 for this example.

2. **Navigate to the chosen spoon:**
   - **Action:** Plan a path to navigate to the position **[2.5, 2.3, 0]** near Spoon2, avoiding obstacles.
   - **Action:** Execute the path and move the robot to the calculated position.

3. **Position the robot's arm for grasping:**
   - **Action:** Adjust the robot's arm configuration to reach the spoon at **[2.5, 2.3, 1.00]**. This may involve moving the base slightly and adjusting the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints.

4. **Grasp the spoon:**
   - **Action:** Open the robot's gripper.
   - **Action:** Carefully move the gripper towards the spoon, ensuring proper alignment.
   - **Action:** Close the gripper to securely grasp the spoon.

5. **Lift the spoon:**
   - **Action:**  Slightly lift the spoon vertically to detach it from its resting surface.

6. **Task completion:**
   - **Action:** The robot now holds Spoon2. The task is complete. The robot can proceed to the next instruction or return to its initial position.


**Note:** This plan assumes that the robot has the capability to:
- Perceive its environment and identify objects (spoons).
- Plan collision-free paths.
- Control its arm and gripper with sufficient precision.
- Understand the concept of "on a table" based on object relationships and positions. 
- Adapt to minor variations in object positions.
