Plan:
User Instruction: Can you set the table for breakfast? I want to eat a bowl of cereals with milk.
---
The following is a pre thinking process for the user instruction. It is not necessarily right especially the Positions. But use it as a foundation for your task:
<thinking>## Setting the Table for Breakfast

**Initial stage:**
- **PR2 Robot:** Located at position **[1, 2, 0]**.
- **Milk:** On the table at **[2.5, 2, 1.02]**.
- **Cereal:** On the table at **[2.5, 2.3, 1.05]**.
- **Bowl:** On the table at **[2.5, 2.2, 1.02]**.
- **Spoon:** Inside cabinet10_drawer_top at **[2.4, 2.2, 0.85]**.

**Goal stage:**
- **Bowl:** On the table, containing cereal and milk.
- **Spoon:** Placed next to the bowl on the table.

**Step-by-step plan:**

1. **Retrieve the spoon:**
    - **Action:** Navigate to cabinet10.
    - **Action:** Open cabinet10_drawer_top.
    - **Action:** Grasp the spoon.
    - **Action:** Close cabinet10_drawer_top.
    - **Action:** Move to the table.
    - **Action:** Place the spoon on the table near **[2.5, 2, 1.02]**.

2. **Prepare the cereal:**
    - **Action:** Grasp the cereal box.
    - **Action:** Move to the bowl.
    - **Action:** Pour cereal into the bowl. 
    - **Action:** Place the cereal box back on the table.

3. **Pour the milk:**
    - **Action:** Grasp the milk carton.
    - **Action:** Pour milk into the bowl.
    - **Action:** Place the milk carton back on the table.

4. **Task completion:**
    - **Action:** The table is set. The robot returns to its initial position or awaits further instructions.


**Note:** This plan assumes the robot has the capability to open drawers, grasp objects, pour liquids, and navigate within the apartment environment. The specific coordinates for placing the spoon and pouring cereal/milk might need adjustments based on the table's dimensions and the robot's reach.  The URDF file would provide more precise information for these actions.

# Define poses for the objects
milk_pose = Pose([2.5, 2, 1.02])  # Position for milk
cereal_pose = Pose([2.5, 2.3, 1.05])  # Position for cereal
bowl_pose = Pose([2.5, 2.2, 1.02])  # Position for bowl

# Define colors (RGBA format)
milk_color = [1, 1, 1, 1]  # White
cereal_color = [1, 0.8, 0, 1]  # Light yellow
bowl_color = [1, 1, 0, 1]  # Yellow

# Create objects with poses and colors
milk = Object("milk", ObjectType.MILK, "milk.stl", pose=milk_pose)
cereal = Object("cereal", ObjectType.BREAKFAST_CEREAL, "breakfast_cereal.stl", pose=cereal_pose)
bowl = Object("bowl", ObjectType.BOWL, "bowl.stl", pose=bowl_pose)

# Set colors for the objects
milk.set_color(milk_color)
cereal.set_color(cereal_color)
bowl.set_color(bowl_color)

# Verify object creation
print(f"Milk Position: {milk.get_position()}")
print(f"Cereal Position: {cereal.get_position()}")
print(f"Bowl Position: {bowl.get_position()}")
```

### Explanation
